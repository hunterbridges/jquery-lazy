{"body":"# Free your bandwidth. Better your life.\r\n\r\nView the [annotated source](docs/jquery-lazy.html)\r\n\r\n`jquery-lazy` is a cross-browser lazy loading image plugin. It's built\r\non top of jQuery. It supports retina devices.\r\n\r\nBrowsers are varying about how they handle cached images. This plugin is\r\ndesigned to accomodate for several failure cases. The project is built\r\nto achieve these goals:\r\n\r\n* Be as flexible as possible\r\n* Work well with browser caches\r\n* Only load images when they are onscreen\r\n* Don't load the same image twice\r\n\r\nTo use lazy, put something like this at the end of your `body`:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery-lazy.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n   if (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined' && jQuery.fn.lazy) {\r\n     (function($){\r\n       $('img.lazy').lazy();\r\n     })(jQuery);\r\n   }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, don't hesitate to call `.lazy()` in your other front-end code.\r\nIf you dynamically add another image to the screen, hit it with\r\n`$('img#my_new_img').lazy();`!","tagline":"A lazy load plugin for jQuery that strives to Just Workâ„¢","note":"Don't delete this file!
